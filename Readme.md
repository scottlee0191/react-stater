# React starter kit

The stater kit provides basic functionality for creating react applications SPA.

## Getting Started

Setup react projects can be painful because there are several things that we can use but we need to have a common approach to reduce the times of the project creation this just my personal experience when working with React come with a lot of different best practices like

1. TypeScript
2. Eslint, Prettier
3. Tailwind, [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
4. React router
5. Vite, Vitest
6. Cypress
7. Linting commit etc.

I hope you will save some time forcus on build SPA product.
