# React starter kit

The stater kit provides basic functionality for creating react applications SPA.

## Getting Started

Setup react projects can be painful because there are several things that we can use but we need to have a common approach to reduce the times of the project creation this just my personal experience when working with React come with a lot of different best practices like TypeScript, Eslint, Prettier, Tailwind, React router, Vite, Vitest, Cypress, Linting commit etc. I hope you will save some time forcus on build SPA product.
